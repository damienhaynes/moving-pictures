    <h1>Media Sources</h1>
    <h2>Watch Folders</h2>
    <p> Moving Pictures will automatically import movie content from the watch folders you
        have added in this section. As new movies are added to your watch folders they will
        also be automatically added to Moving Pictures. Likewise, when movies are deleted
        or moved from your watch folders, they will also be removed from Moving Pictures.</p>
    <h2>Network / Removable Media</h2>
    <p> Moving Pictures will now automatically detect if an import path is on a network
        or removable drive. If an entire import path is taken offline, Moving Pictures will
        not remove any files. Only when files are actually deleted or moved out of an import
        path will they be removed from your library.</p>
    <h2>
        Optical Media</h2>
    <p>
        If the "Automatically Import Inserted DVDs" option is set, all media from any optical
        drives on your system will be loaded when inserted. Generally this means that if
        you play a DVD through Moving Pictures, from that point forward that DVD will be
        listed as a part of your library and when you click play, you will be prompted to
        insert the appropriate disk.</p>
