#summary The cores services that lay the foundation for Moving Pictures.

= Core Services =
This section explains the details of the core sub-systems of Moving Pictures. These components are actually all generalized and could be reused by other plug-ins. The purpose of these components is to provide generic services to the rest of the plug-in. In the future these components will most likely be abstracted to a separate package so other people can base plug-ins on this framework. _No direct link to any !MediaPortal code should exist in these components._
