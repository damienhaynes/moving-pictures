= Folder Structure =
So first things first, let's get the latest version of the source code. Before you do this though, you will need to decide where you want your projects to be stored. You can setup your project and solution files anywhere, but the default location for Visual Studio Projects is "`My Documents\Visual Studio 2008\Projects`". Any location will do if you would rather not work from there. To give you a little visibility, this is the folder structure I am recommending:

So go ahead and create your folder structure. Create the `PluginDev` folder and the `MediaPortal` and `Moving Pictures` folders below that. These three are all you need to do manually, everything else will automatically be pulled down by TortoiseSVN.

=== Checking Out ===
Now that you have your folders created, we need to pull down the latest code for two major projects. The Moving Pictures project and the !MediaPortal project. !MediaPortal is a dependency of Moving Pictures, so let's start with that. Right click the !MediaPortal folder you created previously and click SVN Checkout. If you do not see this you either don't have TortoiseSVN installed or it is not setup properly.

=== Picking Your Repository ===

The only thing you need to change on this popup is the "URL of Repository" field. You have a choice though, you can go with the latest and greatest source code from the !MediaPortal project, or you can go with the source code from the latest tested release. If you want the latest, greatest (and possibly buggy) !MediaPortal code, cut and paste the first of the two URLs below into for your Repository URL, then click OK. 

Using the _latest_ code base for !MediaPortal, one of our dependencies, may not be the best idea though. Most of the users of Moving Pictures are going to be running the plug-in against the latest _release_ of !MediaPortal. So if you want to get the code for the most recent official release, cut and paste the second URL below. *Don't hit OK yet though!* Click the "..." button to pop up the repository browser, right click and refresh the "tags" node and pick the most recent version. At the time of writing, the latest version is 1.0.0.0 RC1, but there may be a newer release by now. Pick the newest. Once you have picked which version of the !MediaPortal code you want, back on the Checkout Dialog click OK to start the checkout. !MediaPortal is a bit large so this may take a few minutes depending on your connection speed.

= Setting up your Visual Studio Solution =
So now that you have Visual Studio and TortoiseSVN installed, you need to setup a Visual Studio solution. This solution will contain the Moving Pictures Project, the Moving Pictures Config Tester project, and a subset of the MediaPortal Projects. If you work on other MediaPortal plugins it might make sense to add those projects to this Solution as well.
