=== Introduction ===
This document will walk you through setting up your development environment to contribute to the Moving Pictures project. If you follow this guide, you should be able to retrieve the latest version of the source code, make bug fixes or enhancements, and submit your changes. This guide details a development environment utilizing Visual Studio 2008 Express and Tortoise SVN, both available for free. It is of course possible to use the full version of Visual Studio along with a source control plug-in such as VisualSVN, but this is not covered here.

= Prerequisites =
As mentioned above, you will at a minimum need two tools to work with the Moving Pictures source code, in addition to the the .NET framework. Once you get going though you might want to consider grabbing a program to browse the Moving Pictures database. Any app that can read SQLite3 database will do.

=== Windows & .NET Framework SDK ===
The .NET framework is the foundation for all .NET (and in turn C#) applications. If you use !MediaPortal the odds are that you already have some version of this installed, but it might be a good idea to grab the latest version. Later in the guide if you have any trouble with References on any of the C# projects (particularly the !MediaPortal projects) you might want to try installing the latest version of the .NET framework. It is very likely downloading and installing this now will save you time and a headache later, so I would recommend going ahead and grabbing this. At the time of writing the following download is the latest and most complete installation of the .NET framework:

=== Visual Studio 2008 ===
All project files for Moving Pictures are in the Visual C# 2008 Project file format. Because Moving Pictures is currently targeted for .NET 2.0, it is possible to use earlier versions of Visual Studio. This is not covered by this guide, and if you choose to use an earlier version, _please do not overwrite the 2008 project files_.

If you do not already have it installed, you will need to install Visual C# before you proceed with the rest of this guide. Visual C# is a subset of Visual Studio, and it is the only portion of Visual Studio you will need. Throughout this document though, these terms will be used interchangeably. Don't get confused, all you need is Visual C#. A walk through for the Visual Studio installation is outside the scope of this guide, but you should not need anything beyond a standard install of the Visual Studio. The Express edition of Visual Studio 2008 is available from Microsoft, free of charge at the following URL, again, you will only need the Visual C# component:

=== TortoiseSVN ===
We will be using TortoiseSVN for retrieving the latest source code and changes from the Subversion repositories for both MediaPortal and Moving Pictures. There are many other Subversion clients you could use, TortoiseSVN just happens to be our favorite. You will need TortoiseSVN installed before proceeding with this guide. You can get the latest version of TortoiseSVN from the following URL:
