The Generic Skin Files
----------------------
If your skin does not support Moving Pictures, don't fret, you can still use the
Generic Skin. But if your skin DOES supports Moving Pictures it is strongly recommended 
you do NOT install the generic skin. The generic skin is meant to be a temporary 
solution to allow all users to enjoy Moving Pictures even if their favorite skin has 
not yet added support. 

If you do choose to use the generic skin, there are installation 
instructions listed below. There is now both a 16x9 and 4x3 generic skin for use. 
If your skin does not yet support Moving Pictures, installing the Moving Pictures 
generic skin will not affect any other aspects of your existing skin. It will not 
overwrite any XML or image files.



Upgrading from a Previous Version
---------------------------------
No special procedures need to be taken to upgrade from a previous version of 
Moving Pictures. Simply copy the new DLL file into the plug-in directory as
described in the Install Instructions below.



Installing Moving Pictures
--------------------------

1) Shutdown MediaPortal.

2) Find your MediaPortal install folder. Usually this is something like 
   C:\Program Files\Team MediaPortal\MediaPortal. 
   
3) Copy the movingpictures.dll file to the Plugins\Windows\ folder under
   your MediaPortal install folder.



Installing the Generic Skin
---------------------------

1) Find your MediaPortal install folder. Usually this is something like 
   C:\Program Files\Team MediaPortal\MediaPortal. Same as above.
   
2) Look under the skin folder. You should see a folder for each skin
   you have installed. Open the folder for your current skin and copy 
   the contents of either the Generic Skin\16x9\ or Generic Skin\4x3\
   folder into it.



Change Log
================================================================================
0.6.6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed OFDb script.

* Selecting a different version of a script will now "stick" after restarting 
  the plug-in

================================================================================
0.6.5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* IMPAwards has been fixed. Covers will be pulled down again.

* Additional fixes were added to prevent Ignored movies from coming back.

* In GUI the first selected movie will now be the first in the list.

================================================================================
0.6.4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue #256: Sometimes when a movie was removed from a watch folder, it did
            not stay deleted. If a movie was moved it became duplicated in the 
            movie list.
            
Issue #267: Sometimes in the importer a movie would be approved as one movie
            but when details were pulled, the details would be for another
            movie or TV Show.
            
Artwork   : Several changes have been made to increase the stability of the 
Scanner     background artwork scanner. This was, in some rare cases causing 
            MediaPortal to crash.
            
themoviedb: Additional error handling was added to the backdrop provider for
            themoviedb.org which was in rare cases causing MediaPortal to crash
            if themoviedb.org failed to respond.

Issue #264: Backdrops for movies with unusual characters in the title (for 
            example, Léon) were not properly pulled from themoviedb.org.


================================================================================
0.6.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMDb:       Corrected a bug in script causing summary information to be omitted
            for some movies.
            
            Corrected bug causing IMDb ID to not be written when rescanning a 
            movie that was originally imported by allocine.


Issue #239: The Allocine.fr scraper script is no longer CPU intensive and will 
            return more reliable results.
            
IMPAwards:  The impawards.com cover art scraper will now return better results 
            for movies with data pulled from allocine.
            
MovieMeter: Fixed bug causing summary information to be omitted for some movies.

OFDb:       Script will now only return movie content.
            

================================================================================
0.6.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMDb Fix:   After a change to the IMDb website, the IMDb script provided in 0.6.1
            would not return results. Moving Pictures 0.6.2 includes an updated 
            script to properly pull results. 


================================================================================
0.6.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue #204: Searching by a custom search string failed and caused the 
            config to crash when searching for a movie sent for 
            reprocessing by the Movie Manager.
            
Issue #203: Multi-part playback was broken. This caused MediaPortal to crash if the
            user did not press stop before the second part of a to part movie ended.
            This also caused three part movies to only play the first part.
            
Issue #189: Importer would fail when NFO Scanner is turned off.

Issue #198: Advanced feature to load backdrops from movie folder caused importer to fail.

Issue #199: In rare situations a file could be added to a watch folder but not get 
            loaded into the importer.

Issue #202: Runtime was still not always populated by the IMDb script.

Issue #205: Filename patterns for backdrop and cover retrieval now properly support
            the %filename% tag.

Issue #181: When using unwatched filter, after watching a movie it was still in the list
            until the watched filter was cycled.
            
Issue #187: Cover in facade did not change when cover art was cycled from the 
            details page.
            
Issue #197: Fields that had no value in some situations were displayed as the skin
            property name rather than am empty field.

Issue #168: Rating stars displayed incorrectly for some locales.

Issue #192: New default backdrop caused odd ghost image on thumbanil views in Generic
            Skin.

Issue #184: The rating star was not properly linked in the 4x3 Generic Skin preventing
            ratings from being displayed.

================================================================================
0.6.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a partial list of enhancements and bug fixes. For a complete list please
visit the following URL: 

http://code.google.com/p/moving-pictures/issues/list?can=1&q=milestone:0.6.0

Enhancements
------------

Watched Flags:              Moving Pictures will now track which movies you have watched 
                            and allow you to filter by unwatched movies.

Resume Playback:            If a movie is stopped before completion, when you start playback 
                            again you have to resume playback where you left off.

Additional Data Sources &   The plug-in will now optionally pull data from OFDb (German), 
Scriptable Scraping Engine: MovieMeter.nl (Dutch) or Allocine.fr (French) in addition to 
                            IMDb. Additionally a scriptable scraping system is now in place
                            for future changes and new scripts.

Enhanced Coverart Support:  Moving Pictures will now pull from multiple data sources to
                            retrieve coverart. Existing providers have been enhanced and 
                            covers from MyVideos will now be imported if no other covers are
                            available.
                            
Remote Control Filtering:   You can now type out a partial name of a movie on the number pad
                            of your remote control "cell phone style" to dynamically filter the
                            movies listed in MediaPortal.

Manual Movie Inserting:     If a match is not coming up for a file you can now manually add the 
                            file to the database and edit the movie details in the Movie Manager.
                            
Unignore Files:             You can now unignore files that had been previously "permanently 
                            ignored". This is currently a bulk feature. Additional granularity 
                            will be added in a future version.

Major Bug Fixes
---------------
Issue #131:    After rapidly opening and closing the config and/or the MP GUI, the plug-in will 
               no longer corrupt the Moving Pictures database.

Issue #126:    Reordering grouped files belonging to a movie is now functional and less confusing.

Issue #112:    Runtime is now properly populated via the IMDb script.

Issue #168:    Rating stars are now properly displayed in all locales.

Plus many more...

================================================================================
0.5.5c
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue #132: Previously, if a movie was added to or deleted from a watch folder
            while MediaPortal and Moving Pictures was offline, the next time 
            MediaPortal launched, the program would crash. Relaunching 
            MediaPortal again would work correctly. This issue has been 
            resolved.

================================================================================
0.5.5b
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue #114: Fixed bug causing unhandled exception when reassigning a set of 
            files to a new movie from the Movie Manager panel.

================================================================================
0.5.5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enhancements
------------
Issue #9:   Scanner will now pull movie details from IMDb.

Issue #30:  Scanner will now pull cover artwork from impawards.com.

Issue #40:  Full DVD rips are now supported.

Issue #49:  DVD Images are now supported. This requires the Daemon Tools integration
            of Media Portal to be turned on, as well as the ISO file extension to be
            added to the list of valid video file extension.

Issue #103: The movie importer will now attempt to retrieve an IMDB ID from an NFO
            file in the folder with the movie. If found, search will be based on 
            this rather than title and year.

Issue #43:  After playback or exiting and re-entering the plug-in, the previously
            selected movie and view will now be retained.
            
Issue #94:  Enhanced multi-part matcher to detect additional filename patterns. 

            
Bug Fixes
---------
Issue #80:  Removing and re-adding an import path in the configuration screen 
            now works as expected, and duplicates movie entries will not be 
            created.

Issue #89:  In the importer, file extension matching is no longer case sensitive. 

Issue #88:  On the movie manager tab of the configuration screen, when the user 
            tries to manually add a cover, but clicks cancel, the cover art will 
            no longer be loaded anyway.
            
Issue #78:  Movie ratings (Score) should now be loading correctly for international 
            users.

Issue #100: HD Quality sample files should no longer squeeze through the sample
            filter.
            
Issue #74:  Filenames with underscores delimiting words should now be imported
            correctly.

================================================================================
0.5.4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue #75: Fixed data provider for movie backdrops (fan-art) from 
           poseters.consumeroo.com backdrop, now known as meligrove.com.
                      
           Also set this data provider as the primary. Effectively this means
           more 1080p artwork. 

Issue #72: If you delete Moving Pictures artwork (covers or fanart) in the 
           "thumbs" folder, references to this artwork will automatically be 
           severed and new artwork will be downloaded. This combined with the
           previous issue means you can delete your backdrop folder and do a 
           Full Rescan to get more 1080p backdrops.

Issue #82: Fixed a bug causing slow file system scans when checking network 
           drives.

================================================================================
0.5.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Major Bug Fixes
---------------
Issue #50: MediaPortal crashed after playback in any plug-in if Moving 
           Pictures had not yet been opened.
  

Importer Changes
----------------
Issue #24: Video files tagged as "samples" in their filename are now filtered
           out, and will not be grouped or automatched.

Issue #46: Year based matching has been enhanced to better parse year data
           from a file/folder name.
 
Issue #52: Created more strict rules for grouping. There should be fewer
           incorrect groupings of sequels now.
  
Issue #54: The movie scanner will no longer fail when scanning a root folder
           on a hard drive.
    
Issue #1:  Grouped matches no longer incorrectly use folder name for search string.

Issue #56: Auto-approve threshold is now lower, meaning matches now must be 
           closer to get auto-approved. This is user definable. Previous 
           setting was 3, and it has been changed to 1. To get previous behavior
           see advanced settings.

Issue #37: Upon launch, the plug-in will now search for new artwork for all
           movies currently missing cover-art or a movie backdrop.


MediaPortal GUI Changes
-----------------------
Issue #44: Plug-in will now dynamically update GUI in MediaPortal when movie
           files have been added to or deleted from an Import Path.

Issue #60: Movies will now be removed from the system when corresponding import 
           path has been removed (confirming first).

Issue #34: A (configurable) delay has been added to the GUI. This increases the
           time to load backdrops and cover-art, but dramatically improves 
           performance when moving rapidly through a list, thumbnail view, etc.
           Additional enhancements are upcoming for this...

Issue #42: The play button no longer holds focus after exiting details view.

Issue #33: Filmstrip scrolling is significantly improved.
           
Issue #45: Display of lists (actors, genres, etc) n GUI are now limited to 5
           elements (configurable).

Issue #51: Focus now remains on view button when cycling views.
